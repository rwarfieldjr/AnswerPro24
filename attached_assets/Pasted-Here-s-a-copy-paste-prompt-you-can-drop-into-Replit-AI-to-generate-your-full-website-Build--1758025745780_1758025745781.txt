**3 Value Pillars**

1. **Screening That Protects Your Time** — AI captures name, number, address, issue, photos/video link, urgency, warranty status.
2. **Smart Escalation** — If criteria met (e.g., active water leak, no heat in freezing temps), we **ring your on-call tech**. Otherwise we **schedule for morning**.
3. **Zero Missed Leads** — Every call becomes a ticket with summary + transcript + recording link (optional).

**How It Works (4 steps)**

1. **Forward Your Number After Hours** (we provide instructions and a dedicated number).
2. **AI Answers & Assesses** (collects details, classifies urgency).

4. **Deliver**: You get a morning digest + real-time alerts for escalations.
