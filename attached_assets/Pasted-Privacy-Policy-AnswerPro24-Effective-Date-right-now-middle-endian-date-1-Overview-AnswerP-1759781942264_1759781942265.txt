Privacy Policy — AnswerPro24

Effective Date: {{right_now.middle_endian_date}}

1) Overview

AnswerPro24 (“AnswerPro24,” “we,” “us”) provides AI-powered after-hours call answering and routing for home-service businesses. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when you use our services, sites, and related tools (the “Service”).

By using the Service, you agree to this Policy and our Terms of Service.

2) Roles and Definitions

Customer: the business that signs up for the Service.

End Caller: the individual who calls or is called on behalf of a Customer.

Controller vs. Processor: For Customer contact data and call content, the Customer is the data controller and AnswerPro24 is the data processor. For our own marketing, billing, fraud prevention, and analytics, AnswerPro24 is the controller.

3) Information We Collect

Account & Billing: business name, contact person, email, phone, address, payment method, invoices.

Service Data: phone numbers, call metadata (timestamps, duration), call audio, recordings, transcriptions, routing/escalation settings, CRM integration data, message logs, support tickets.

Technical Data: device/browser info, IP address, cookies, usage logs, event logs, diagnostics.

Communications: emails, chats, support interactions, surveys, testimonials (with permission).

4) How We Use Information

Screen, route, record, transcribe, and analyze calls.

Send real-time alerts and daily summaries.

Detect abuse, secure the Service, and debug issues.

Train and evaluate models using aggregated and/or de-identified data.

Billing, account management, and compliance with law.

We do not sell personal information.

5) Call Recording & Consent

Calls may be recorded and/or transcribed. Customer is responsible for obtaining all legally required consents from End Callers (including two-party consent jurisdictions). If you use SMS/A2P messaging with us or your CRM, you must obtain valid opt-in/consent and honor opt-out requests.

6) Data Retention

Recordings/Transcripts: retained 90 days by default, unless Customer requests a longer period in writing.

Logs/Metadata: retained as needed for security, operations, and legal requirements.

Deletion: upon verified request and subject to legal holds/backups, we delete or anonymize data.

We may share information with:

Service Providers/Subprocessors (e.g., cloud hosting, telephony, storage, analytics, support).

CRM/Integrations at Customer’s direction.

Legal/Compliance: to comply with law, enforce agreements, or protect rights and safety.

Corporate Transactions: merger, acquisition, or asset transfer (with continued protections).

A current list of subprocessors is available on request.

8) Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (encryption in transit, access controls, monitoring, least-privilege). No system is 100% secure; Customers must secure their own credentials, seats, and integrations.

9) International Data Transfers

If data is transferred across borders, we use legally recognized mechanisms (e.g., SCCs) where required.

10) Your Choices & Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing.

Customers: manage your data in the dashboard or contact us.

End Callers: please contact the relevant Customer (data controller). We will assist the Customer as the processor.
