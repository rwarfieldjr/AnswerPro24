Offer Architecture (what they actually get)

Action → Impact

Greeting & triage that mirrors their brand.
“Thanks for calling [Brand]. Are you experiencing an emergency right now? Press 1…”
→ Feels like their receptionist; higher trust.

Escalation logic built for trades:
Emergency? → hot transfer + SMS to on-call tech. Non-urgent? → schedule slot.
→ Right calls reach the right person; fewer late-night disruptions.

Morning brief & analytics:
9am text/email: count of calls, emergencies handled, bookings, recordings/transcripts link.
→ Visible ROI that justifies $499.
